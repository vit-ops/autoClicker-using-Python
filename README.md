# 🖱️ AutoPython

**AutoPython** is a minimalist and modern auto-clicking utility developed in Python. It was designed to replace clunky terminal scripts with a professional Graphical User Interface (GUI), offering seamless control and a frustration-free experience.

## ✨ Key Features
- **Modern Interface:** Powered by `CustomTkinter` for a native Dark Mode aesthetic.
- **Panic Hotkey (F8):** Toggle clicking on or off instantly from anywhere, even if the window isn't focused.
- **Self-Bundler:** A unique "Generate EXE" button that compiles the script into a standalone executable using PyInstaller.
- **Safety Failsafe:** Built-in protection — move your mouse to the top-left corner of the screen to kill the process immediately.
- **Auto-Dependency Management:** The script automatically detects and installs missing libraries (`customtkinter`, `pyautogui`, `keyboard`, `pyinstaller`) on its first run.
